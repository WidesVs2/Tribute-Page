    <h2 id="info-head">Stefan Molyneux: The Man</h2>
    <p class="info-para">Molyneux was born in Ireland and raised mainly in London before moving to Canada at the age of
      11. Molyneux attended the Glendon College of York University, where he was an actor at Theatre Glendon and a
      member of the Debating Society. He then attended the National Theatre School of Canada in Montreal. In 1991, at
      age 25, Molyneux received a B.A. degree in History from McGill University. He later received an M.A. degree in
      History from University of Toronto in 1993.</p>
    <p class="info-para">In early 1995, Molyneux and his brother Hugh founded Caribou Systems Corporation, a
      Toronto-based provider of environmental database software. The company was sold in 2000.</p>

    <p class="info-para">In 2005, Molyneux began a podcast called Freedomain Radio (FDR). He uses the same name for the
      website on which he distributes his own writings, hosts podcast archives, and provides an Internet forum for FDR
      listeners. Molyneux also produces videos and commentary on current events, and he presents a weekly call-in show
      on which listeners can ask questions or discuss personal issues. Molyneux funds his efforts by soliciting direct
      payment from listeners and viewers.</p>

    <h2 id="info-head">The Philosopher</h2>
    <p class="info-para">Stefan Molyneux is the founder and host of Freedomain Radio, the largest and most popular
      philosophical show in the world. With more than 3,500 podcasts, 10 books and 250 million downloads, Stefan has
      spread the cause of liberty and philosophy to listeners throughout the world.</p>

    <p class="info-para">Prior to launching Freedomain Radio, Stefan built a thriving career as a software entrepreneur
      and executive. In 2006, he left his work in the tech industry to devote his efforts to Freedomain Radio. Now a
      full-time parent and philosopher, Stefan has given speeches at liberty-themed events all over the world. His
      speeches cover subjects ranging from politics, philosophy, economics, relationships, bitcoin, parenting and how to
      achieve real freedom in your life.</p>

    <p class="info-para">Past live appearances include presentations at the New Hampshire Liberty Forum, Libertopia,
      Students For Liberty, FreedomFest, LibertyNow, Capitalism and Morality, LibertyFest West, the Brazilian Mises
      Institute's Idieas em Movimento, Freedom Summit and The Next Web Europe Conference.</p>

    <p class="info-para">Stefan has participated in a number of live debates, among them: "Bitcoin vs. Gold: The Future
      of Money" with Peter Schiff, "Zeitgeist Versus the Market" with Peter Joseph, "The Function of the State in
      Society" with Professor Vladimir Safatle and "How Much Government is Necessary?" with Michael Badnarik.</p>
